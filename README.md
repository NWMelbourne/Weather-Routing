# Weather-Routing
I developed this isochronal weather routing python3 code as an undergrad with support from the University of Hawaii at Manoa undergraduate research opportunities program (UROP).

### Use
**Installation:**
The code is dependent on the following packages:

* **numpy (pip install numpy)**
* **matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)**
* **pygrib (pip install pygrib)**
* **mpl_toolkits.basemap (pip install basemap)**
* **urllib3 (pip install urllib3)**

With these, python 3.8+ should be able to run the code.

**Run:**

All optimization parameters are listed just below the package imports near the top of main.py. 
The relevant parameters for simple use are:


### Theory

The theory section delves into the core concepts behind [Main heading].

* **Core principles:** Explain the fundamental principles of how [Main heading] operates (e.g., for a machine learning model, describe the learning algorithm).
* **Algorithms and Techniques:** Describe the algorithms or techniques used by [Main heading] (e.g., mention specific algorithms like decision trees or neural networks). 
* **Mathematical background (Optional):** If relevant, include any mathematical concepts or equations that support the theory (e.g., for a linear regression model, you might mention the concept of least squares). 

### Limitations

This section discusses the limitations of [Main heading]. 

* **Use cases:** Mention scenarios where [Main heading] might not be the most suitable option (e.g., if the model requires a large amount of data and you have a limited dataset). 
* **Shortcomings:** Highlight any known shortcomings or areas where [Main heading] could be improved (e.g., mention accuracy limitations or sensitivity to specific data types).
* **Interpretation considerations:** Discuss any considerations users should keep in mind when interpreting results obtained from [Main heading] (e.g., for a classification model, discuss the potential for bias or the importance of evaluating metrics like precision and recall).

This markdown file provides a template you can adapt for your specific content. Remember to replace the bracketed text (e.g., [Main heading], [Main short description], [main_heading_package_name]) with your own information.
