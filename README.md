# Weather-Routing
I developed this isochronal weather routing python3 code as an undergrad with support from the University of Hawaii at Manoa undergraduate research opportunities program (UROP).

### Use
**Installation:**
The code is dependent on the following packages:

* **numpy (pip install numpy)**
* **matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)**
* **pygrib (pip install pygrib)**
* **mpl_toolkits.basemap (pip install basemap)**
* **urllib3 (pip install urllib3)**

With these, python 3.8+ should be able to run the code.

**Run:**

All optimization parameters are listed just below the package imports near the top of main.py. 
The relevant parameters for simple use are:
